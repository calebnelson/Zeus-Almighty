How to play the Game:
Once you click the play game button from the main menu, you will be taken to the game screen. Peasants 
will start running across the screen from the right; your job as Zeus is to smite the peasants by tapping 
the cloud above them to summon lightning bolts. Peasants struck by the lightning will be killed. Any peasant 
that gets across the screen will deduct life from your health bar. Once your health bar is empty, you will lose.
Then the "GAME OVER" will pop up and peasants will continue to run across the screen as a screen saver until you use the back button on the phone to go back to the main menu.

How to run on an emulator:
Download genymotion or another emulator and run the apk off of that.

How to run on Android:
Download and run the Zeus Almighty apk. Run the Zeus Almighty app from your list of applications.
